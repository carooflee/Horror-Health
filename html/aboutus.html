        Welcome to Horror Health! This website was created out of a love of horror and the catharsis it can bring to people with various mental health issues
        or traumatic experiences in their lives. Whether that be PTSD, depression, addiction, or simply growing up on the outside of what's considered normal.
        The project was inspired initially by haunted house films, their parallels to abusive home environments, and the surprising comfort they provided for me. Over the years we've seen an uptick in horror films making mental health 
        the focus of their horror or horror themes, such as The Lighthouse, Hereditary, and Oculus. Notably, though, horror films have always dealt with mental health issues of
        some kind, though often indirectly. This can be seen in how many horror fans watch these films: as a way to safely process a contained level of fear and anxiety, 
        while still getting a resolution we so often lack in personal struggles with mental health.
        <br><br>
        With this in mind, Horror Health compiles an ever-growing list of horror films and provides a brief breakdown of it's core mental health themes, the level of catharsis one 
        might derive from the film if they relate to such themes, and a list of potential triggers for those who might not be in a position to receive said catharsis. Obviously, everyone's
        experience is unique, so trust your own judgement when deciding if a film may be helpful or hurtful, but otherwise, feel free to haunt our pages! ☠️
