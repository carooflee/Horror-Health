## Horror Health
 
A mental health-oriented horror movie app with trigger and catharsis ratings.

# Motivation

As a horror fan who stuggles with mental health and past traumas, I would like a website which can tell me what triggers I might encounter in a particular film, as well as if there is any level of catharsis which might come from said film.
  
# Usage
Simply click on the deployed link below and click through the various films collected on the site to find a summary, trigger rating, catharsis rating, and list of potential triggers.
